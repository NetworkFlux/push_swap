## Challenge -- ðŸ’¡

  

With only 2 stacks of integer values *(a and b)* and a limited set of instructions *(see below)*, try to sort stack a with the lowest possible number of action.

  
  

## Objectives -- âœ…

  

Sorting values is simple. Sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. The goal is :

- **700** instructions on average for a stack of **100** integers

- **5000** instructions on average for a stack of **500** integers


## Rules

If you are interested in the specifics of the project here is how it is supposed to work :

-   You have 2 stacks named a and b.
    
-   At the beginning:
    
    The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated.
        
     The stack b is empty.
     
-   The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the
    
    following operations at your disposal:
    
    sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
    
    sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
    
    ss : sa and sb at the same time.  
    pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
    
    Do nothing if b is empty.  
    pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
    
    Do nothing if a is empty.  
    ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
    
    The first element becomes the last one.
    
    rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
    
    rr : ra and rb at the same time.  
    rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
    
    The last element becomes the first one.
    
    rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
    
    rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
