## Topics -- ðŸš¨

1. Sorting algorithms

2. Complexity

3. C

  

## Challenge -- ðŸ’¡

  

With only 2 stacks of integer values *(a and b)* and a limited set of instructions *(see below)*, try to sort stack a with the lowest possible number of action.

  
  

## Objectives -- âœ…

  

Sorting values is simple. Sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. The goal is :

- **700** instructions on average for a stack of **100** integers

- **5000** instructions on average for a stack of **500** integers
