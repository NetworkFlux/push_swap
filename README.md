## 🚨 -- Topics
1. Sorting algorithms
2. Complexity

## 💡 -- Challenge

With only 2 stacks of integer values *(a and b)* and a limited set of instructions *(see below)*, try to sort stack a with the lowest possible number of action. 


## ✅ -- Objectives

Sorting values is simple. Sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. The goal is :
- **500** instructions on average for a stack of **100** integers     ✅
- **5000** instructions on average for a stack of **500** integers    ✅
