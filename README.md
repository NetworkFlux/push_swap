1. Sorting algorithms
2. Complexity

## Challenge -- ðŸ’¡

With only 2 stacks of integer values *(a and b)* and a limited set of instructions *(see below)*, try to sort stack a with the lowest possible number of action. 


## Objectives -- âœ…

Sorting values is simple. Sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. The goal is :
- **500** instructions on average for a stack of **100** integers     âœ…
- **5000** instructions on average for a stack of **500** integers    âœ…
